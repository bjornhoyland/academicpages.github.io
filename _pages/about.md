My research interests are legislative politics, applied political methodology and computational social science. My empirical focus is the European Union, in particular the European Parliament (EP), but also bicameral relations between the EP and the Council, as well as legislative and budgetary politics. I maintain an easy-to-use data-base of [Members in the European Parlimament](https://nabu.usit.uio.no/sv/isv/). If you finds the webpage useful for your research, please cite [this paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1465116508099764) with Indraneel Sircar and Simon Hix.  With Simon Hix, I am writing the 4th edition of [the Political System of the European Union](https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/The-Political-System-of-the-European-Union/?K=9780230249813). I also do work on national parliments, such as the Canadian House of Commons and, more recently, the Norwegian Parliament.
