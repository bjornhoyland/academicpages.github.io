We present an automatically updatable database of background information
about Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from 1979 until the
present. Although this information is already directly accessible through the
European Parliament’s web page, it is presented in a manner that makes it
ideal only for those interested in finding information about individual MEPs,
but difficult for anyone interested in doing large-N analysis. We provide an
online ‘live’ source of background information about MEPs that is tailored
towards the need of the latter group. Our web page allows researchers to
specify the time period in which they are interested and to obtain data on
committee, party group and delegation membership, as well as leadership
positions within seconds. As the collection of the data is fully automated, we
are able to keep the data updated as long as the European Parliament (EP)
continues its current practice of making background information about
members available online.
