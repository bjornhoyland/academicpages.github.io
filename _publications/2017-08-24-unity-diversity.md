excerpt: 'Abstract What explains the development of legislative party voting unity? Evidence from the 
United States and Britain indicate that partisan sorting, cohort replacement effects, electoral 
incentives, and agenda control contributed to enhancing party cohesion during the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Here, these mechanisms are evaluated by analysing a 
dataset containing all the recorded votes from the Canadian House of Commons, 1867–
2011. Overall, we find that partisan sorting and the government's ability to control the 
agenda are central to the consolidation of parties over time. Our results underscore the need 
to integrate institutional rules and legislative agendas into models of parliamentary voting 
behaviour and suggest that strict party discipline can lead to the development of a multi-
party system in the legislative arena.'

What motivates politicians to engage in legislative activities? In multilevel systems politicians may be incentivized by ambitions to advance their careers either at the state or federal level. This article argues that the design of the electoral institutions influences how politicians respond to these incentives. Analyzing a unique dataset of both ‘stated’ and ‘realized’ career ambitions of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), it finds that those who seek to move from the European to the national (state) level participate less in legislative activities than those who plan to stay at the European (federal) level. For MEPs who aim to move to the state level, attendance and participation in legislative activities is substantively lower among legislators from candidate-centered systems. Importantly, the effect of career ambitions on legislative participation is stronger in candidate-centered systems than in party-centered systems. These findings suggest that the responsiveness associated with candidate-centered systems comes at the expense of legislative activity.
