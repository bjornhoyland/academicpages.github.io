This is a course in quantitative political science. The aim is to provide a rigorous foundation
for students interested in applying quantitative methods in their own research.
The rst part of the course provides a thorough treatment of generalized linear models.
We will cover both standard models and their hierarchical extentions. The main text for
this part is Long, S. J. (1997). Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent
Variables. SAGE, London. The second section of the course covers event-history models.
Here, the main text will be Box-Steensmeier, J. M. and Jones, B. S. (2004). Event History
Modeling: A Guide to Social Scientists. Cambridge University Press.
We will use R, a free statistical programming language. It is available at www.r-project.org.
Here, you will also nd a lot of useful information about R. I also recommend you to use
Rstudio, www.rstudio.org for running R on your computer. I use LATEX to typeset my
papers and presentations. It works great in combination with R and Rstudio. If you are
serious about learning R, study Matlo, N. (2011). The Art of R Programming: A Tour of
Statistical Design. No Starch Press: San Fransisco. An introduction to LATEX can be found
here: http://ctan.uib.no/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf.
The course aims to teach students how to do reproducable research. In order to integrate
LATEX and R, we will use knitr, http://yihui.name/knitr/.
Each week will have two lectures and one computer class. One lecture will be devoted to
the statistical properties of the model, assumptions and generalization. The second lecture
will focus on estimation and interpretation of the estimates obtained from the model. The
purpose of the computer classes is to develop programming tools to become a productive
quantiative political scientist.
