In this course, you will learn to analyze decision-making in the European Union. The course consists of three parts; Government, Politics, and Policies. The premise for the course is that although the EU is not a state, it can be analyzed using standard theoretical tools from mainstream political science. The empirical focus is on how the EU is currently operating. We expect you to follow EU current affairs, and be able to interpret contemporary developments in light of the theoretical tools. Moreover, you will develop the ability to find and extract relevant material for the EU political system.

The course is based my book  with Simon Hix, I am writing the 4th edition of [the Political System of the European Union](https://www.macmillanihe.com/page/detail/The-Political-System-of-the-European-Union/?K=9780230249813)
